# Todo List Application

## Overview

This project is a full-stack Todo List application with a React frontend and an node.js backend. Users can create, update, delete, and search tasks. The frontend is deployed on Netlify, while the backend is hosted on Render.

### System Design

- **Frontend**: Built with React, this part of the application handles user interactions and communicates with the backend API to perform CRUD operations.
- **Backend**: Developed using Express and Node.js, the backend provides API endpoints for task management and stores data in a JSON file.

## Implementation

### Frontend

The React frontend provides a user-friendly interface for task management. The key components include:

- **App.js**: The main component responsible for fetching tasks from the backend and handling task operations like adding, updating, deleting, and searching.
- **TaskForm.js**: A form component for adding new tasks and editing existing ones.
- **TaskList.js**: Displays a list of tasks.
- **TaskItem.js**: Represents individual tasks, including functionalities to toggle completion status, expand for details, edit, and delete tasks.

The frontend interacts with the backend through HTTP requests using Axios.

### Backend

The backend is an Express application with the following API endpoints for task management:

- `GET /tasks`: Retrieves all tasks, with optional search filtering.
- `POST /tasks`: Adds a new task.
- `PUT /tasks/:id`: Updates an existing task.
- `DELETE /tasks/:id`: Deletes a task.

It operates on a port defined by the environment variable `PORT`, defaulting to `5000`.
